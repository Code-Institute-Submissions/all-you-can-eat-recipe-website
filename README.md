## All You Can Eat Recipe Website
All You Can Eat Recipe Website is my Milestone 3 project. It is a website where users can search for, upload and store recipes that they would like to use in the future. It covers all the main meals of the day (breakfast, lunch, dessert & dinner) as well as a catch all category of snacks.

Users are also able to search through the website for keywords in the text in order for them to discover new recipes that they might like. It also has a display box to show if it contains gluten and if it is vegan or not.

## UX
This website was designed with a few types of users in mind. You can find the user stories below. The users must be able to search the recipe website, add recipes, edit & delete (their own) recipes as well as if they have admin rights to add a new category. Otherwise if the user does not have admin access, they can only add their own recipes to a category of choice. The website is also responsive to mobile with a side bar menu that opens up to view the menu items.


* As a serious fitness user, I want to use this website as a base to store my favourite healthy recipes
* As a professional (nutritional therapist) I want to create & display an example eating plan for my clients
* As a user who enjoys cooking, I want to explore other peoples recipes and get inspiration
* As a professional chef, I want to be able to store my recipes, display them and allow other people to make them

## Features
### Existing Features
1. Users can register by filling out a username & password on the registeration form
2. Before registeration, users can only see a limited menu. After registeration, they are able to see the entire menu and go on to add/edit/delete the recipes
3. On mobile view, users can open the menu by clicking on the hamburger menu. While the menu is open, scrolling is disabled to prevent users from losing their place on the website.
4. Users can search the website for keywords within the recipes and find their desired result. If no result is found, a message is displayed saying that their are no results found for their search.
5. Users can explore full CRUD functionality when creating websites. They are able to create, read, update & delete websites that they created. With websites from other users, they are only able to read.
6. Users are able to store their own recipes within the database for later retrieval
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
7. Users can add up to 13 ingredients & up to 6 instructions

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
